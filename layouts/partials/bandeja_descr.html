    The main parts of our recording suite are middle-range smartphone Samsung S10e and high-quality depth camera <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kinect-dk/">Azure Kinect DK</a>. Sensors are synchronized on time and frame level with sync precision less than 1 msec using <a href="https://github.com/MobileRoboticsSkoltech/twist-n-sync">Twist-n-Sync</a> approach. All the system components are mounted on the hand-held plywood platform designed to carry them comfortably during recordings. A metal rig strengthens the platform body to have constant relative transformations between every sensor. The system is battery-powered and can work several hours after full charge.
